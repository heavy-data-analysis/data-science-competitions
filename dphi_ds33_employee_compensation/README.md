## Content
**Employee compensation** involves all the ways your organization gives back to team members for their hard work. The obvious form of compensation is pay, whether it’s salaried, hourly, or sales-based. It’s important that how much an organization financially compensates an employee is fair, especially in terms of balancing the job role itself and the organization’s budget.

The salary or compensation to be paid to an employee of an organization depends on various factors like the organization group, department, job, salaries, etc. of the employee.

## Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist in a big organization which has thousands of employees. The HR department is planning to provide some additional compensation to each working employee which needs to be calculated by looking at the profile of each employee and the benefits they are getting.

The HR department asks your help if you can use your data science and machine learning skills and calculate an estimated ‘Total Compensation’ for each employee.

## Objective
You are required to build a machine learning model to estimate the total compensation to be provided to an employee.
