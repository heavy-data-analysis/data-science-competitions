## Problem
It can be difficult to navigate the logistics when it comes to buying art. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Effective collection management
- Shipping the paintings, antiques, sculptures, and other collectibles to their respective destinations after purchase

Though many companies have made shipping consumer goods a relatively quick and painless procedure, the same rules do not always apply while shipping paintings or transporting antiques and collectibles.

## Task

You work for a company that sells sculptures that are acquired from various artists around the world. Your task is to predict the cost required to ship these sculptures to customers based on the information provided in the dataset.

## Data description
The dataset folder contains the following files:

- **train.csv**: 6500 x 20
- **test.csv**: 3500 x 19
